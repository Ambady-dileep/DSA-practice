# 🧠 DSA Practice in Python

This repository contains my daily practice problems for Data Structures and Algorithms using Python.  
Problems are organized by difficulty: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**.

## 📁 Folder Structure
problems/
├── easy/
├── medium/
└── hard/


- `easy/`: Basic problems to build core concepts.
- `medium/`: Requires logic, understanding of DS.
- `hard/`: Advanced problems — dynamic programming, graphs, etc.

## 🎯 Goals

- Solve **100+ DSA problems**
- Master Python for problem solving
- Prepare for coding interviews
- Build strong logic and debugging skills

MASTER PROMPT

I am a beginner in DSA and want to practice [TOPIC NAME, e.g., Arrays, Strings, Linked List, Hashing, DP]. 
Give me a structured list of coding problems that:
1. Start with very basic logic-building drills (loops, conditions, indexing).
2. Progress step by step into standard LeetCode-style Easy problems.
3. End with slightly harder Easy / bridge-to-Medium problems.
Separate the list into clear levels (Level 1: logic drills, Level 2: LeetCode Easy, Level 3: harder Easy).
The problems should train me to think in patterns and prepare me for interviews.

✅ Beginner-Friendly Problem Set (Arrays + Strings)
🟢 Level 1 (Very Basic Logic Building)

👉 Do these to train your loop + condition + indexing brain:

Reverse an array

Find the max and min in an array

Count how many times a number appears

Check if an array is sorted (ascending)

Count vowels in a string

Reverse a string

Check if a string is a palindrome ("racecar" → true)

Count frequency of each character in a string

Remove all spaces from a string

Find the first non-repeating character in a string

Find the sum of all elements in an array

Find the average of elements in an array

Find the second largest element in an array

Find the second smallest element in an array

Find the index of a given element in an array

Find the missing number in a sequence (e.g. [1,2,4,5] → 3)

Find the duplicate number in an array (e.g. [1,2,3,3,4] → 3)

Remove duplicates from an array (return new array)

Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array

Find the intersection of two arrays

Find the union of two arrays

Left rotate an array by 1 (or by k steps)

Right rotate an array by 1 (or by k steps)

Find the element that appears only once (others appear twice)

Count even and odd numbers in an array

🟢 More Beginner-Friendly String Problems

Convert a string to uppercase / lowercase

Count the number of words in a string

Find the longest word in a string

Reverse each word in a sentence ("Hello World" → "olleH dlroW")

Check if two strings are anagrams ("listen", "silent")

Count how many times a character appears in a string

Replace all vowels in a string with *

Remove all digits from a string ("a1b2c3" → "abc")

Find the most frequent character in a string

Remove duplicate characters from a string ("banana" → "ban")

Find the first repeating character in a string

Find the last non-repeating character in a string

Reverse only the vowels in a string ("hello" → "holle")

Check if a string contains only digits

Find the longest substring without repeating characters

🔑 Why These Drills Matter

Arrays → teach you indexing, iteration, conditions.
Strings → teach you manipulation, hashing, frequency maps.
Together → form the base for LeetCode Easy problems.
