# 🧠 DSA Practice in Python

This repository contains my daily practice problems for Data Structures and Algorithms using Python.  
Problems are organized by difficulty: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**.

## 📁 Folder Structure
problems/
├── easy/
├── medium/
└── hard/


- `easy/`: Basic problems to build core concepts.
- `medium/`: Requires logic, understanding of DS.
- `hard/`: Advanced problems — dynamic programming, graphs, etc.

## 🎯 Goals

- Solve **100+ DSA problems**
- Master Python for problem solving
- Prepare for coding interviews
- Build strong logic and debugging skills

MASTER PROMPT

I am a beginner in DSA and want to practice [TOPIC NAME, e.g., Arrays, Strings, Linked List, Hashing, DP]. 
Give me a structured list of coding problems that:
1. Start with very basic logic-building drills (loops, conditions, indexing).
2. Progress step by step into standard LeetCode-style Easy problems.
3. End with slightly harder Easy / bridge-to-Medium problems.
Separate the list into clear levels (Level 1: logic drills, Level 2: LeetCode Easy, Level 3: harder Easy).
The problems should train me to think in patterns and prepare me for interviews.

✅ Beginner-Friendly Problem Set (Arrays + Strings)
🟢 Level 1 (Very Basic Logic Building)

👉 Do these to train your loop + condition + indexing brain:

Reverse an array
Find the max and min in an array
Count how many times a number appears
Check if an array is sorted (ascending)
Count vowels in a string
Reverse a string
Check if a string is a palindrome ("racecar" → true)
Count frequency of each character in a string
Remove all spaces from a string
Find the first non-repeating character in a string
Find the sum of all elements in an array
Find the average of elements in an array
Find the second largest element in an array
Find the second smallest element in an array
Find the index of a given element in an array
Find the missing number in a sequence (e.g. [1,2,4,5] → 3)
Find the duplicate number in an array (e.g. [1,2,3,3,4] → 3)
Remove duplicates from an array (return new array)
Merge two sorted arrays into one sorted array
Find the intersection of two arrays
Find the union of two arrays
Left rotate an array by 1 (or by k steps)
Right rotate an array by 1 (or by k steps)
Find the element that appears only once (others appear twice)
Count even and odd numbers in an array

🟢 More Beginner-Friendly String Problems

Convert a string to uppercase / lowercase
Count the number of words in a string
Find the longest word in a string
Reverse each word in a sentence ("Hello World" → "olleH dlroW")
Check if two strings are anagrams ("listen", "silent")
Count how many times a character appears in a string
Replace all vowels in a string with *
Remove all digits from a string ("a1b2c3" → "abc")
Find the most frequent character in a string
Remove duplicate characters from a string ("banana" → "ban")
Find the first repeating character in a string
Find the last non-repeating character in a string
Reverse only the vowels in a string ("hello" → "holle")
Check if a string contains only digits
Find the longest substring without repeating characters

🔑 Why These Drills Matter

Arrays → teach you indexing, iteration, conditions.
Strings → teach you manipulation, hashing, frequency maps.
Together → form the base for LeetCode Easy problems.
