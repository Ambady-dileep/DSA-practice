# 🧠 DSA Practice in Python

This repository contains my daily practice problems for Data Structures and Algorithms using Python.  
Problems are organized by difficulty: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**.

## 📁 Folder Structure
problems/
├── easy/
├── medium/
└── hard/


- `easy/`: Basic problems to build core concepts.
- `medium/`: Requires logic, understanding of DS.
- `hard/`: Advanced problems — dynamic programming, graphs, etc.

## 🎯 Goals

- Solve **100+ DSA problems**
- Master Python for problem solving
- Prepare for coding interviews
- Build strong logic and debugging skills

## ✅ Progress Tracker

| Problem                     | Difficulty | Status  |
|----------------------------|------------|---------|
| Two Sum                    | Easy       | ✅ Done |
| Merge Intervals            | Medium     | ❌ Todo |
| Longest Palindromic Substr | Hard       | ❌ Todo |

MASTER PROMPT

I am a beginner in DSA and want to practice [TOPIC NAME, e.g., Arrays, Strings, Linked List, Hashing, DP]. 
Give me a structured list of coding problems that:
1. Start with very basic logic-building drills (loops, conditions, indexing).
2. Progress step by step into standard LeetCode-style Easy problems.
3. End with slightly harder Easy / bridge-to-Medium problems.
Separate the list into clear levels (Level 1: logic drills, Level 2: LeetCode Easy, Level 3: harder Easy).
The problems should train me to think in patterns and prepare me for interviews.
