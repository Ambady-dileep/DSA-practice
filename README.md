# 🧠 DSA Practice in Python

This repository contains my daily practice problems for Data Structures and Algorithms using Python.  
Problems are organized by difficulty: **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard**.

## 📁 Folder Structure
problems/
├── easy/
├── medium/
└── hard/


- `easy/`: Basic problems to build core concepts.
- `medium/`: Requires logic, understanding of DS.
- `hard/`: Advanced problems — dynamic programming, graphs, etc.

## 🎯 Goals

- Solve **100+ DSA problems**
- Master Python for problem solving
- Prepare for coding interviews
- Build strong logic and debugging skills
