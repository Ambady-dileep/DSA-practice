# Create a circular queue
# Merge two sorted arrays
# Check if a string is balanced
# Get the first non-repeating character from a string
# Sort array alphabetically using QuickSort
# Best sort algorithm = Tim sort is the best
# Use of each sorting algorithm
# Hash table implementation
# Time and space complexity calculations
# Circular queue implementation
# Double ended queue implementation
# Implement stack using LL
# merge two sorted list
# What is the main disadvantage of Selection Sort and other sorts?
# remove longest string from array
# check if array is sorted or not
# implement stack
# implement queue

# ðŸ’ª TL;DR Summary
# Need	                 Use This Sort

# Fastest average case	âš¡ Quick Sort
# Stable sort needed	ðŸ§Š Merge / Timsort
# Memory is tight	    ðŸ’ª Heap / Quick
# Already sorted	    ðŸ§½ Insertion Sort
# Real-world use	    ðŸ”¥ Timsort
# Linked list sorting	ðŸ§Š Merge Sort
