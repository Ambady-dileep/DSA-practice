# 🧠 KEY IDEA:
# Merge Sort splits by index.
# Quick Sort splits by pivot value.
# 🧠 Merge Sort = "Split by half ➝ Merge"
# 🔥 Quick Sort = "Split by pivot ➝ No Merge"

# Merge Sort:
# “Break everything into halves, sort them, then combine like a puzzle.”

# Quick Sort:
# “Put everything in its correct zone around a pivot, and recursively sort each zone.”
