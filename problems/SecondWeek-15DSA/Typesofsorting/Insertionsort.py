# 🧠 What is Insertion Sort?
# Insertion Sort builds the final sorted array one element at a time,
# just like sorting a hand of playing cards 🃏.
# You pick one element, shift everything greater than it to the right, and insert it into its correct position.

# 📊 Visualization:

# Unsorted:
# [4, 3, 5, 1]
# First: take 3, insert before 4 → [3, 4, 5, 1]
# Next: 5 is already in place
# Then: insert 1 before all → [1, 3, 4, 5]

        print(f"Key is {key} at index {i}")
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and arr[j] > key:
            print(f"{arr[j]} > {key} -> shifting {arr[j]} to position {j + 1}")
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key
