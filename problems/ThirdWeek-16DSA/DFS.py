# üîÅ Whole concept in a real-world analogy

# Imagine a rescue operation üöÅ
# You rescue person A first.
# Then you find A‚Äôs friends: B and C.
# You put B and C in a queue (you‚Äôll rescue them next).
# Then you go to B, then to C, then to their friends (if any).
# That‚Äôs BFS. You rescue by levels ‚Äî not by diving deep.
