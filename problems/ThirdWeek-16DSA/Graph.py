# ðŸ”‘ What is a Graph?

# Example: Think of Facebook. Each person = node. Each friendship = edge.

# âœ… Graph Terminology (in Plain English)
# Term	             Meaning	               Example
# Node(Vertex)       A point	             A, B, C, D
# Edge	             A connection	         A â†’ B
# Undirected	     Edge without direction  A-B is same as B-A
# Directed (Digraph) Edge has direction	     A â†’ B is not B â†’ A
# Weighted	         Edge has cost/value	 A -3-> B (weight = 3)
# Unweighted	     No value on edge	     A â†’ B (just a link)
# Degree	         No. of edges on a node	 A has 2 edges â†’ degree = 2
