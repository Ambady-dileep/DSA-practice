# ðŸŒ² What is a Binary Tree?

# A Binary Tree is a type of data structure where:
# Each node can have at most two children
# One called the left child
# One called the right child

#       10
#      /  \
#    5     20
#   / \    /
#  3   7  15

# ðŸ’¥ Why Binary Trees Are Important
# Use Case	How Itâ€™s Used
# Storing hierarchical data	File systems, organization charts
# Searching/sorting	Binary Search Trees, Heaps
# Expression parsing	Compilers, calculators
# AI/Game Trees	Decision making

# ðŸŽ¯ Types of Binary Trees You Must Know:

#       Type	                      Description
# Full Binary Tree	        Every node has 0 or 2 children (never just 1)
# Perfect Binary Tree	    Full + all leaves at same level
# Complete Binary Tree	    All levels are filled except the last, and last is filled left to right
# Balanced Binary Tree   	Height is minimized, diff of height in left & right â‰¤ 1
# Binary Search Tree (BST)	Left < root < right
# Heap (Min/Max)	        Complete + heap property (min/max root)
