# ⚠️ BOOM This is the brutal, red-alert zone of Big O — and very few problems are allowed to be this slow unless absolutely necessary. Let’s break it down like a war plan:

# 💣 What is O(n!)?
# O(n!) = Factorial Time Complexity
# It means the time (or number of steps) grows as the factorial of n.

# ❓ What is factorial?
# n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 2 × 1

# Example:
# 3! = 3×2×1 = 6
# 4! = 4×3×2×1 = 24
# 5! = 120
# 10! = 3,628,800
# 20! = 2.43 * 10¹⁸ (you’re dead 💀)

# 🔥 What it means:
# If your input is just n = 10,
# your algorithm might do 3.6 million steps.
# That’s horribly slow — only acceptable for very small n like 10 or less.

# 🧠 Where does O(n!) happen?
# Mostly in problems where you try every possible order or arrangement of things.
