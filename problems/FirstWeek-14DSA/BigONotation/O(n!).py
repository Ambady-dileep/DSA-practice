# ⚠️ BOOM This is the brutal, red-alert zone of Big O — and very few problems are allowed to be this slow unless absolutely necessary. Let’s break it down like a war plan:

# 💣 What is O(n!)?
# O(n!) = Factorial Time Complexity
# It means the time (or number of steps) grows as the factorial of n.

# ❓ What is factorial?
# n! = n × (n-1) × (n-2) × ... × 2 × 1

# Example:
# 3! = 3×2×1 = 6
# 4! = 4×3×2×1 = 24
# 5! = 120
# 10! = 3,628,800
# 20! = 2.43 * 10¹⁸ (you’re dead 💀)

# 🔥 What it means:
# If your input is just n = 10,
# your algorithm might do 3.6 million steps.
# That’s horribly slow — only acceptable for very small n like 10 or less.

# 🧠 Where does O(n!) happen?
# Mostly in problems where you try every possible order or arrangement of things.

# ⚔️ Why is O(n!) so dangerous?
# Because it grows faster than anything else:

# n	O(n)	O(n²)	O(2ⁿ)	O(n!)
# 5	5	25	32	120
# 10	10	100	1024	3,628,800
# 15	15	225	32,768	1.3 * 10¹²
# 20	20	400	1M	2.4 * 10¹⁸

# 😨 See the pattern?
# Even if your CPU runs at lightning speed, you can't survive n! past 15 or 20.

# If the problem asks for “all arrangements,” “all paths,” “all combinations of everything” —
# you’re probably in O(n!) territory.

# ✅ Real Dev Strategy:

# ❌ NEVER use O(n!) unless:
# n is small (like 8 or 10)
# There’s no other choice

# ✅ Use smarter techniques like:
# Backtracking with pruning
# Dynamic Programming (TSP with memoization)
# Greedy approximations

# 🧠 Dev Mindset Quote:
# "If your solution is O(n!), then your real job is to find a smarter way. Unless n is tiny, you're building a bomb — not a solution."
