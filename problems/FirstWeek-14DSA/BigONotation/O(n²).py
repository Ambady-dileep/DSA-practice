# 💣 What is O(n²)?
# "Quadratic Time Complexity"
# 👉 The time taken grows with the square of the input size.

# ⚠️ Key Rule to Remember:
# Sign you’re in O(n²) land:
# You see two full for loops
# You do nested work like "compare with all others"
# Or you do a recursion with loop inside it
# O(n²)	 -->  Quadratic	 -->  Bubble Sort, brute pair compare


# If:
# Input = 10, steps ≈ 100
# Input = 100, steps ≈ 10,000

# 🔥 Real-Life Example:

# You're in a room of n people, and each person shakes hands with every other person.
# That's not just 1 handshake per person.


# ❓ Does Recursion always mean O(n²)?
# 🚫 NO. Recursion is NOT always O(n²).
# 👉 Recursion is just a technique, like a hammer. The time complexity depends on how you use it.
